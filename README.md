# Controller
Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition

## Purpose
Existing SCADA software feels clunky. I wanted something that felt right to me.

## Roadmap
- [X] Get CI set up
- [ ] Get code coverage (codecov.io) set up
- [ ] Get UI toolkit set up (consider web-view instead of sciter-rs)
- [ ] Get scripting set up
- [ ] Get some hardware working (Labjack?)
- [ ] Get a comprehensive widget collection built up
